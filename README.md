Problem Statement-
A traffic intersection has a problem with traffic congestion during peak hours. The traffic lights are 
poorly timed, causing long wait times and traffic jams. Your task is to implement a traffic light 
control system that will reduce the wait time for drivers and improve traffic flow. The traffic 
light system consists of two intersections, North-South and East-West.

The state machine diagram of the soultion implemented is available in the repository. The other files in the repository include code for setup and implementation of the problem.
